Predicting Car Testing Time using Machine learning.
Business problem
The aim is to reduce testing time by analyzing the currently available data which is collected from hundreds of tests on thousands of car configurations. There might be cases that two cars belong to same Class but differ in one or more feature. So there testing time will be different. Hence for such cases, the machine learning model can help to predict accurate time spent on a test bench for cars with the same class but some different features.
The basic problem statement is to create a machine learning model that will predict the accurate time a car spends on the test bench and tackle the curse of dimensionality.
